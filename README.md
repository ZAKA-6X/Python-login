# Python-login:

This Python program implements a secure login system with user registration functionality. It offers the following features:

    User-friendly interface: Presents a clear menu for signing in, signing up, or quitting.
    Authentication: Verifies user credentials when signing in, preventing unauthorized access.
    Secure password storage: Doesn't store passwords in plain text, providing an extra layer of security.
    Unique username enforcement: Ensures new users choose unique usernames for registration.
    Informative feedback: Provides appropriate messages during login and registration processes.
    Time delays: Adds short time delays to enhance the user experience and mimic real-world systems.

Potential improvements:

    Error handling: Consider adding input validation and error handling for invalid entries.
    Password strength: Implement checks for password strength to encourage secure passwords.
    Data persistence: Explore storing user data in a file or database for persistence beyond program execution.

This project effectively demonstrates basic login and registration functionalities, and with further enhancements, it can become a robust and secure user management system.
